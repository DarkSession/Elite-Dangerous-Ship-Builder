import { Routes } from '@angular/router';

/**
 * The application's routes.
 *
 * Five screens, each addressable by what it is about: the product's own address
 * by the product, hull detail by the hull's own name, the two benches by the
 * work done at them — `/outfitting` a ship, `/equipment` a Commander.
 *
 * The saved builds are not among them. They are a layer over the screen a
 * Commander is on and nothing else — no address, no history entry of its own,
 * no document of its own to crawl (Commander request 2026-09-04). The
 * routes-and-ui contract asks that a *surface* be addressable, and the library
 * is not one: it is a list of records held on this device, which no address off
 * this device could resolve and no crawler could read. What it opens — a build
 * — has an address, and that is where a Commander lands.
 *
 * `title` and `data.description` are message keys rather than phrases:
 * `RouteTitleStrategy` resolves both in the committed locale, so the document
 * title and the sentence a search result quotes change language with everything
 * else rather than one navigation later (011/FR-027). A route that declares no
 * description inherits the nearest ancestor's — and so does one whose key names
 * a subject the route cannot resolve, which is what makes a hull address no
 * hull answers to read as the catalogue rather than as a blank.
 *
 * No route carries build data in its path or query. The only build payload in
 * a URL is the `/outfitting` fragment (FR-015).
