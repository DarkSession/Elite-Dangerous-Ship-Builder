 * `SHOT CONVERGENCE`: where this build's shots land on the plane a target sits
 * on, as canvas 1c draws it (@649971) and canvas 1d draws it again (@1039230).
 *
 * The geometry is the package's. `SHIP_GUNSIGHTS` publishes every player-flyable
 * hull's hardpoint offsets from the cockpit in metres, and `projectGunsight`
 * turns those offsets into angular tangents at a chosen range. This file places
 * every one of the hull's hardpoints, armed or empty, asks the package where
 * their shots go, and says how far apart the armed ones are; it derives no
 * offset and models no ballistics.
 *
 * Every hardpoint and not only the armed ones, because the plate is a picture
 * of the *hull*: an offset is a property of the mount, which the package
 * publishes whether or not a Commander has filled it, and a Commander choosing
 * what to fit is asking where a shot from that mount would go. The empty ones
 * are drawn as the mounts they are and are named as empty in words, and no
 * figure about the group is measured across them — nothing is fired from an
 * empty hardpoint, so a spread that counted one would be a spread nobody has.
 *
 * A hull the catalogue does not carry, or one whose gunsight does not line up
 * with its hardpoints, is `unavailable` rather than a partial diagram: a
 * convergence drawn from some of the mounts would be a spread nobody has.
