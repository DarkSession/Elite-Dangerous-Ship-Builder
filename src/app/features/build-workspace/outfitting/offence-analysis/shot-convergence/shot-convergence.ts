 * them out on — a plate 172px across carrying eight numerals was a page of
 * digits over a diagram, and every one of them was already the first word of
 * that mount's own sentence beside the plate.
 *
 * What each mark carries — whether a weapon is on it, and whether it is the
 * mount the workspace currently has selected — is drawn as three inks and
 * written out in the mark's own sentence, because a colour is not a reading
 * (011 FR-010). How the weapon aims is in that sentence and nowhere else: the
 * canvas's own second ink is spent on selection here
 * (`design/canvas-contract.md`, review note 17).
