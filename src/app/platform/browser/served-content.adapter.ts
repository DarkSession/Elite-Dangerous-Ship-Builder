/**
 * A copy of what the address served, taken before the application takes over.
 *
 * The build writes a document for every content-bearing address (015/FR-018),
 * so a Commander is reading that address's content before any script runs. The
 * takeover then hands the document to a screen the application presents —
 * except where no screen is presented, and there the served content has to
 * still be standing. Nothing else in the application has a view of it. The
 * nodes hydration finds nothing to claim are cleared from a bootstrap listener
 * once the application is stable, which is after the navigation has failed and
 * after the copy has gone back — so the two co-exist for a moment, and nothing
 * the Commander is reading is ever missing from a frame. What there is no
 * moment for is a later reading: from the takeover onward the document is the
 * application's, part adopted and part waiting to be cleared, and asking it
 * what the address served would be asking it about itself.
 *
 * So the copy is taken first, in a browser-only application initializer
 * registered before `provideRouter`, where the DOM is still the served document
 * and nothing has been claimed (`app.config.ts`).
 *
 * **A copy, not a detachment.** Detaching the served nodes would blank the page
 * at the moment the Commander is reading it, and would leave hydration nothing
 * to adopt when the navigation succeeds — which is the defect this exists to
 * prevent rather than to cause. The live document is not touched here at all.
 *
 * **Nodes, not a string.** A string would be parsed again, and what goes back
 * has to be what the address served rather than a second reading of it
 * (023/FR-001, "It MUST be kept as the address served it: not rebuilt, not
 * recomputed, not written again").
 *
 * It renders nothing and decides nothing. When the copy goes back, and when it
 * is dropped, is `ServedDocumentStore` — this owns the copy and the document
 * seam alone (constitution III).
