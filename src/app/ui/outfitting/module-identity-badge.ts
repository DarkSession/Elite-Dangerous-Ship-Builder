/**
 * What identifies one module.
 *
 * The canvas writes it as a name over a tracked mono code line —
 * `Huge Multi-Cannon` above `4A GIMBALLED` — and that is what this renders. The
 * class, the rating and the mount are three separate package values, never a
 * string parsed out of a symbol: `4A` looks like it could be read off
 * `Hpt_MultiCannon_Gimbal_Huge`, and on the Python Mk II's thrusters that habit
 * is already wrong (constitution II).
 *
 * `symbol` is shown only when `showSymbol` is set. Most module names are unique
 * enough to choose by; a few are not, and where two rows would otherwise read
 * identically the identity has to be visible rather than hidden behind an
 * ellipsis (module-replacement design, "identity ambiguity").
