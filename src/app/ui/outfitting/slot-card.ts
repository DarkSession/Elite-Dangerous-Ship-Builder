/**
 * One mount in the ledger.
 *
 * The canvas draws a row: a size number, a node badge for hardpoints, the
 * module's name over its code line, an engineered marker, and a power-priority
 * control. This renders exactly that, with three changes the reference cannot
 * make for itself.
 *
 * **The row is not a control.** The canvas's row is a clickable `div` wrapped
 * around a clickable priority `div`, which is a control inside a control — a
 * reader cannot tell which one they are on and a pointer cannot reliably hit
 * the inner one. Selection, replacement and power are separate named controls
 * instead (reference review, "Interaction and semantics").
 *
 * **The slot key is not visible text.** Neither canvas draws one; they draw
 * `SIZE · NODE NO.`. The exact key is the identity everything else uses, so it
 * is carried as `visually-hidden` text and as a `data-slot-key` attribute the
 * anatomy exchanges — the invisible accessibility floor, not an addition to the
 * design (reference review, "Visible slot key").
 *
 * **The engineered marker is not an icon alone.** The canvas uses a small
 * glyph; a glyph is not readable and disappears in forced colours, so the
 * engineering is also stated in the code line where the canvas already writes
 * `OVERCHARGED G5` (FR-010 of feature 011).
