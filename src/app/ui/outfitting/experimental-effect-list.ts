 *
 * Unlike the blueprint list, each option here *does* carry a description: the
 * Almanac publishes one per effect, so the canvas's `−3% ENEMY HULL RESIST ·
 * −20% AMMO` line is package text rather than a claim of ours. Where the
 * package has none, the row says so instead of going quiet.
 *
 * Two shapes, and the menu is the application's own rather than the platform's.
 * A native option holds one run of text, so a description could only be joined
 * onto the name, and the menu became thirteen sentences (Commander request
 * 2026-08-30). The menu draws the two lines the card list draws, at the same
 * two steps, and states its own roles: a button that names the chosen effect
 * and says whether its list is open, over a listbox whose options each say
 * whether they are the selected one.
