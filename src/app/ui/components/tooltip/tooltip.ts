/**
 * A short gloss on the word beside it, drawn when a reader asks for it.
 *
 * The reference canvases hang this kind of gloss on a `title` attribute or a
 * `data-tip`. Neither is built here. A `title` cannot be styled, cannot be
 * reached by touch, is announced inconsistently and disappears the moment the
 * pointer moves — it is not a tooltip so much as the absence of one. This is
 * the system's own: a real element, drawn from the token layer, reachable by
 * every input the application supports.
 *
 * ## Why the gloss is never actually hidden
 *
 * The tip is in the accessibility tree at all times, related to its trigger by
 * `aria-describedby`, whether or not it is currently drawn. So what the control
 * governs is whether the gloss is *drawn*, never whether it is *available*:
 * hover-only meaning is unreachable by touch (011 FR-006), and a reader who is
 * told the interface rather than shown it never has to find a control to hear
 * this. `aria-expanded` says which of the two the trigger is in, so the visual
 * state is programmatically determinable rather than carried by visibility
 * alone (011 FR-010).
 *
 * The native `button` role and that permanent description are also what carry
 * the fact that there is more here to read. The dotted rule under the word is
 * an affordance and nothing more — a line style cannot be the sole carrier of
 * meaning any more than a colour can (011 FR-010, and the semantics contract's
 * "line style" clause).
 *
 * ## How it opens, and how it closes
 *
 * A hover, a focus, and a press. A press because touch has no hover at all, and
 * a tip only a mouse could reach would be exactly the `title` this component
 * exists to replace. Hover is admitted only from a real mouse (`pointerType`):
 * a tap fires `pointerenter` too, and admitting it would open the tip and let
 * the `click` that follows shut it again, so a touch could never open one.
 *
 * A hover and a focus last exactly as long as they do. A press *pins*, and
 * clears the other two so that it is pinning rather than racing them — so a
 * press opens a closed tip, keeps a hovered one after the pointer moves on, and
 * a second press puts it away, whichever pointer it came from.
 *
 * ## Dismissible, hoverable, persistent
 *
 * Success criterion 1.4.13, which is not one of the seven keyboard criteria the
 * constitution excludes and so applies in full. Each of its three parts is a
 * decision here rather than a consequence:
 *
 * - **dismissible.** `Escape` is listened for on the *document*, not on this
 *   host. A tip opened by hover alone leaves the focus wherever it was, so a
 *   host listener would never see the key — the one case the criterion exists
 *   for. {@link dismiss} ignores the key unless this tip is the one on screen,
 *   so a tooltip elsewhere on the page is not quietly poisoned by it.
 * - **hoverable.** The bubble stands off the trigger by a gap, and the gap is
 *   bridged by the bubble's own `::before` — see the stylesheet. Being a child
 *   of the host is not enough on its own: `pointerleave` fires on geometry, not
 *   on parentage, so an unbridged gap collapses the tip just as the pointer
 *   sets off to read it.
 * - **persistent.** Nothing times out. It closes when the pointer leaves, when
 *   focus leaves, on the second press, or on `Escape`.
 *
 * ## Why the bubble is raised out of the row it belongs to
 *
 * A tip drawn in place is drawn inside whatever the row it is on happens to be,
 * and the rows these marks are on are boxes that cut their content. A manifest
 * row declares `content-visibility: auto`, so the rows a Commander has not
 * reached are not laid out — that is paint containment, and paint containment
 * clips every descendant to the row's own box, whatever the descendant's
 * `z-index` says. The identity cell cuts a name too long for its column with
 * `overflow: hidden`, and cuts the bubble with it. The manifest's pane is a
 * scroller, and cuts whatever reaches its edges. Measured on the fitting
 * manifest at 1440x900: the bubble was drawn, at full size, at the right
 * coordinates, and none of it reached the screen — hovering a route mark
 * appeared to do nothing at all (Commander request 2026-08-29).
 *
 * So while it is drawn the bubble is raised into the **top layer**, by the
 * platform's own `popover`, which is outside all three. `manual` rather than
 * `auto`: this component already governs when the tip closes, and an `auto`
 * popover would also close every other one that is open and answer `Escape`
 * behind {@link dismiss}'s back.
 *
 * It is raised without moving: the element stays the child of this host that it
 * always was, so `aria-describedby` still resolves to it, and a pointer that
 * travels from the trigger on to the bubble still has not left the host — which
 * is what keeps "hoverable" above true. The top layer is where it is *painted*,
 * not where it lives.
 *
 * Where the platform has no `popover` — the unit suite's DOM is one — nothing
 * is raised and the bubble is drawn where it is written, which is what every
 * placement outside a cutting box gets anyway.
