    // Without this, Angular treats a generated document as debris: it empties
    // `<app-root>` and renders the application into it from nothing. Measured
    // on `/ships/Anaconda`, that is the hull's figures painted at 39ms, gone at
    // 181ms, and back at 1236ms — a second of the page a Commander was already
    // reading being blank, which is exactly the content that "disappears and
    // returns" that 015/FR-009 forbids and SC-003 measures.
    //
    // Hydration walks the rendered DOM instead and adopts it, so the nodes a
    // Commander is looking at are the nodes the application goes on to own.
    //
    // `withEventReplay()` is the other half. A generated document paints every
    // control before any script has run, so a Commander can press one in that
    // window — and without replay the press lands on markup with no listener
    // behind it and nothing happens at all. That is a control that looks
    // interactive and is not, which is a worse first frame than the empty shell
    // this feature replaced. Replay records those presses and delivers them
    // once the application owns the node.

    // initializer and releases bootstrap part-way through, so the router's
    // first `NavigationStart` — and, where the first screen's code never
    // arrives, its `NavigationError` — is raised before any component exists.
    // A store created with the shell would miss them: it would take the press
    // after the arrival for the session's first navigation and draw nothing
    // over it, and a first navigation that failed would be stated to nobody
    // (018/FR-001, FR-004, FR-007).
    //
    // The order is the whole point, so it is stated by position: this
    // initializer is registered before `provideRouter` below, and initializers
    // run in the order they are provided.
    //
    // The renderer does not need it this early. It runs one navigation and has
    // no Commander to state a wait to (015/FR-001), and the shell it builds
    // injects the store anyway — what the guard leaves out is the initializer,
    // not the store.

    // The initial navigation blocks bootstrap, which is what lets the takeover
    // above adopt a screen instead of rebuilding it. Every screen here is behind
    // a lazily loaded route, so without this the router reaches the outlet
    // before that route's chunk has arrived, throws away the document's copy of
    // the screen and draws its own a moment later. Measured on
    // `/ships/Anaconda`: the whole inspector — manufacturer, speed, shield, hull
    // mass, every hardpoint count — left the page for one frame and came back,
    // and on a phone the hull sheet was replaced by the whole catalogue, 1029
    // pixels tall becoming 4857. That is the content that "disappears and
    // returns" 015/FR-009 forbids and SC-003 measures.
    //
    // Not in development, and this is the same ruling as the service worker
    // below rather than a new one: there is no rendered document on a
    // development server, so there is nothing for a blocking navigation to
    // protect and Angular says so — NG05001 calls hydration and enabled
    // blocking initial navigation a contradiction, which is exactly what they
    // are where nothing was rendered to hydrate. The warning is `ngDevMode`
