 * The other half of this feature's journey — `search-visibility.spec.ts` —
 * watches the application rewrite the head as a Commander moves. This half
 * never runs the application at all. It fetches the documents the build wrote
 * and reads them, because that is what a crawler and a chat client do, and
 * because the two halves fail differently: the head can be perfect in the
 * browser while every address serves a 404 with the site's own title on it.
 *
 * It needs the production output, so it runs under `pnpm run e2e:offline`
 * beside the other journeys that do (`playwright.config.ts`,
 * `NEVER_IN_A_DEVELOPMENT_RUN`). `scripts/serve-production.mjs` resolves
 * `<path>.html` before a directory, which is the order GitHub Pages resolves
 * in, so `/ships` here answers with the document the deployment publishes
 * rather than with the single-page fallback.
