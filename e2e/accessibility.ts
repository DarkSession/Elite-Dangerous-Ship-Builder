/**
 * One sweep, applied to every outfitting state.
 *
 * Feature 002 has a lot of states — workspace, chooser, engineering, no-build,
 * empty, no-match, unavailable, refusal, normalization, history-disabled — and
 * every one of them owes the same evidence. Writing that evidence out per state
 * would guarantee that one of them ends up with four checks instead of eight,
 * and nobody would notice which. So the sweep is one function and every state
 * calls it (responsive composition, "Verification matrix").
 *
 * What it does not do is judge. Whether a name is meaningful and whether a
 * reading order makes sense stay in the named assertions beside each journey
 * and in the manual screen-reader protocols; this is the floor beneath them.

/**
 * What one sweep is allowed to cost, added to the test's budget when it runs.
 *
 * Six passes over a rendered tree — an axe analysis, a heading walk, a target
 * measurement, an overflow check and a clipping check — cost 5–7 seconds on a
 * developer machine and roughly twice that on a CI runner, whose cores are
 * slower and are being shared by four workers. A test that sweeps three states
 * therefore wants around 45 seconds of the 30 the default gives it, which is how
 * `outfitting-history` came to time out on CI while passing everywhere else.
 *
 * The budget is **added per sweep** rather than set to a fixed number, because
 * what a test needs is a function of how many states it draws: one sweep gets
 * 45 seconds, three get 75, and a test that grows a fourth state grows its
 * allowance with it instead of quietly moving back towards the edge. Additive
 * also means it cannot compound — `test.slow()` multiplies the current timeout,
 * so calling it once per sweep would hand a three-state test 810 seconds and
 * turn a genuine hang into a very long wait.

/**
 * The full sweep over one rendered outfitting state.
 *
 * `label` names the state in every failure message, because "axe violations"
 * with no state attached sends whoever reads it looking through ten of them.
 *
 * The state includes where the page stands. Two of the rules scanned here are
 * geometric — a target's size and its distance from its neighbours — and both
 * are read against the viewport, so a control parked behind the sticky command
 * bar is an obscured target for as long as the page is left at that offset.
 *
 * **So the sweep says where it stands, rather than each caller saying it.
 * Ruled 2026-08-27.** It stands at the top. Forty-odd callers reach their state
 * by pressing something, and a press scrolls whatever it has to in order to
 * land — including the document, once the workspace column releases and the
 * page is the tall thing. That left the sweep judging an offset nobody chose:
 * selecting the cargo hatch at 834x1112 parked the anatomy 233px up, under the
 * command bar, and `target-size` read the bar's own `?` as a target zero pixels
 * from the mount marks beneath it. At the top the same sweep is clean.
 *
 * It is the state a Commander meets, too. They reach a mount by scrolling the
 * ledger's own rail, which is what the rail is for; the document moving under
 * them is the test harness reaching a row, not a Commander reading a screen.
 * And a control that a sticky bar covers at some offset is
 * `2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured`, one of the criteria the constitution
 * excludes — it is not the spacing `2.5.8` is about, which is whether two
 * targets can be told apart by a thumb.
 *
 * A caller that means to sweep a scrolled state scrolls after this and says so,
 * which is what `mobility-and-jump` already does for the state it is about.
