 * `EQUIVALENT_TARGETS` below. If a rule ever needs excluding, the verification
 * contract sets the bar: a versioned rule-to-criterion record from the

/**
 * The one rule result that is answered rather than fixed, and the one node it

 *
 * WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 offers four ways to satisfy it, and axe can only check two
 * of them: the 24-pixel size minimum and the spacing exception. The hull
 * schematic's mount marks meet neither and cannot: the Almanac draws real
 * mounts closer together than 24 CSS pixels at the plate widths this screen has
 * room for, so a mark large enough to pass would sit on top of its neighbour
 * and take that mount out of reach entirely.
 *
 * They take the criterion's **Equivalent** exception instead — "a function can
 * be achieved through a different control on the same page that meets the
 * minimum". Feature 002's outfitting ledger is that control: it stands beside
 * the plates, carries every mount the plates draw at the full 44-pixel
 * baseline, and reaches every one of them without the artwork.
 *
 * The exception is asserted, not asserted-to: `expectEquivalentControls` walks
 * the mounts actually drawn and fails if any of them has no full-size row. The
 * rule stays enabled for every other node on every page, and a mount that ever
 * stops having an equivalent fails there rather than passing quietly here.
