/**
 * Writes the list of addresses the build renders a document for.
 *
 * `prerender.routesFile` in `angular.json` names this file, and
 * `discoverRoutes: false` beside it means this list is the whole set: the
 * builder renders these addresses and no others. So what is written here
 * decides, exactly, which of the 52 advertised addresses answer with a body.
 *
 * **Derived, never listed.** The addresses come from `contentBearingAddresses`,
 * which is `publishedAddresses` — the same function the sitemap is written from
 * — with feature 015's content-bearing verdict attached. A hull that arrives
 * with a pin move arrives here with nothing to remember, and a hull that leaves
 * leaves (constitution II, 015/FR-006, 015/SC-009).
 *
 * **Not committed, deliberately.** It is a build input regenerated on every
 * build, so it cannot drift from the address list the way a committed file
 * could. The sitemap stays committed for the opposite reason: a hull arriving
 * or leaving should show up in review, and that is the file where it does.
 *
 * It is written outside the builder's own output directory, because `ng build`
 * empties that before it reads anything.
 *
 * The builder joins each line with the configured `baseHref`, so the sub-path
 * preview build needs no separate handling here.
