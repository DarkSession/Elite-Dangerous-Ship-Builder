/**
 * Holds every generated document to the package it was rendered from.
 *
 * Feature 015 renders 50 of the 52 advertised addresses at build time, so what
 * a crawler reads is a file rather than a frame. That file is written once and
 * then never looked at again — which is the whole problem. A component that
 * stops rendering a hull's mass lock, a formatter that starts rounding, a
 * publishing step that overwrites a body with a shell: each of those leaves a
 * build that exits 0, 52 addresses answering 200, and every head correct. None
 * of the existing gates compares a body to anything.
 *
 * So this one does, and it fails the build rather than letting a document that
 * has stopped matching the package be published (015/FR-020).
 *
 * **It is a script test rather than an end-to-end one** because the comparison
 * needs the package itself, which a browser cannot import — and because
 * `pnpm run test:scripts` already runs in CI, where the end-to-end production
 * suite is a separate job (`contracts/prerendered-document.md`).
 *
 * Run through `node --test`, like every other gate in this directory.
