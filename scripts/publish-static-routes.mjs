/**
 * Writes the document each published address answers with.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, because they answer different callers. `404.html` catches
 * every address, which is what a Commander following a deep link needs — but
 * GitHub Pages serves it with a 404 status, and a crawler drops a 404 whatever
 * the body says, canonical link included. So every address the sitemap
 * advertises is also written as a file that answers 200.
 *
 * `<address>.html`, not `<address>/index.html`. Pages serves `/ships` from
 * `ships.html` with a 200 and no redirect; from a directory it answers 301 to
 * `/ships/`, which would make the address the sitemap and the canonical both
 * advertise the one address that does not answer.
 *
 * The copy is not byte for byte. A document that kept the root's canonical,
 * card and title would tell a crawler to index `/` instead — the same outcome
 * the 404 status had, reached a different way. Each address's document carries
 * its own canonical, `og:url`, title, description and card image, resolved in
 * bundled English from the same catalogue the running application resolves them
 * from. Every substitution is checked rather than assumed, because a silent
 * no-op here looks exactly like a published address.
 *
 * **What the head is applied to changed with feature 015.** Until then there was
 * one template — the built `index.html` — copied to all 52 addresses, which was
 * harmless because every body was an empty `<app-root>`. The build now renders a
 * body for the 50 content-bearing addresses, and copying a shell over them would
 * overwrite every one: a build that passes every head assertion here and ships
 * nothing. So the template is per address — that address's own rendered document
 * — and only the two head-only addresses are still written from the shell
 * (`contracts/address-set.md` §5).
 *
 * **The shell is `index.csr.html` now, not `index.html`.** `index.html` is the
 * root's rendered document, because GitHub Pages resolves `/` to that file and
 * to no other. So the content-free shell Angular emits beside it is what
 * `404.html` is copied from, and what the two benches are written from. A
 * `404.html` still copied from `index.html` would answer every unmatched
 * address with the start page's content (address-set.md §3).
 *
 * It reads the sitemap through `readSitemap`, the same function the policy
 * checker reads it through, so there is no second spelling of the cut for the
 * two to disagree over. Being a script rather than a deployment step also puts
 * what a crawler is served under `pnpm run test:scripts` and under the
 * production journey, where it can be run twice.
