# Nav Beacon

Browser-based tools for Elite Dangerous. Ship Builder is the first of them: pick
a hull, fit and engineer modules, read the resulting build metrics, and export
the build as SLEF. It runs at **[navbeacon.app](https://navbeacon.app/)**.

The application is **client-side only**. There is no backend and no account:
builds live in your browser (`localStorage`) or in a URL, and nothing is ever
uploaded. See [`CONSTITUTION.md`](./CONSTITUTION.md) for the principles this
project is held to.

Game data and build calculations come from
[`@elite-dangerous-almanac/core`](https://github.com/DarkSession/Elite-Dangerous-Almanac),
which is the single source of truth: defects and gaps there are fixed in the
library, never worked around here.

Desktop, tablet and mobile are all first-class targets.

## Status

In use. Twenty-five capabilities are specified and built, in three groups: the
ship builder, the equipment builder, and the platform every screen is composed
from. Each one's specification is in
[`openspec/specs/`](./openspec/specs), and each is the record of what the
capability owes a Commander.

The application is installable, works offline after first load, and reads in
English and German.

## Requirements

- Node.js — see [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) and `package.json#engines`
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (enabled via `corepack enable`)

The [dev container](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) provides all of the above,
plus the GitHub CLI, Python and Claude Code. Open the repository in a dev
container and everything is installed for you.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start        # dev server on http://localhost:4200/
```

Run `pnpm run check` before proposing a change.

## Running and debugging

The dev server binds to `0.0.0.0` so the dev container's forwarded ports reach
it; the addresses stay the same (`http://localhost:4200/` for the product,
`http://localhost:4300/` for the preview catalogue).

Pick **`ng serve`** in Run and Debug (`F5`) or run the `ng serve` task
(`Ctrl+Shift+B`) — both start the same server in a terminal you can stop. VS
Code opens the app on your own machine when it forwards port 4200; the
container has no browser to attach a debugger to, so its developer tools do
the front-end debugging.

Unit tests do run under the debugger: the **`ng test`** launch configuration
runs them in watch mode and stops on breakpoints in specs and source.

## Testing

Unit tests live beside their source in `src/` and run on Vitest through the
Angular unit-test builder. Coverage is enforced at **80%** for statements,
branches, functions and lines; the thresholds are configured in
[`angular.json`](./angular.json) and a build below them fails.

End-to-end tests live in [`e2e/`](./e2e) and run on
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as part of `pnpm run check`.
[`playwright.config.ts`](./playwright.config.ts) generates **ten projects** —
five layout profiles in each of two engines:

| Profile          | Viewport   | Touch | Engines           |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| desktop          | 1440 × 900 | no    | Chromium, Firefox |
| tablet portrait  | 834 × 1112 | yes   | Chromium, Firefox |
| tablet landscape | 1112 × 834 | yes   | Chromium, Firefox |
| mobile portrait  | 390 × 844  | yes   | Chromium, Firefox |
| mobile landscape | 844 × 390  | yes   | Chromium, Firefox |

Every rendered product and preview state is scanned with
[`@axe-core/playwright`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/playwright)
against WCAG 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 level A and AA, with no rule disabled; an in-scope
violation fails the build and the full result is attached to the failure. On top
of the ten projects the suite runs 200% text-scale, 320 CSS-pixel reflow,
reduced-motion, expanded-copy and right-to-left variants, and the production
offline and update journeys under `pnpm run e2e:offline`.

CI may shard the matrix; it may not reduce it. The project names are generated
from the same constants the coverage ledger uses
([`e2e/coverage-ledger.ts`](./e2e/coverage-ledger.ts)), and `pnpm run policy`
reconciles the two.

Automation is a floor. The versioned manual protocols in
[`e2e/manual/`](./e2e/manual) — screen-reader journeys and actual 400% browser
zoom — cover what no scan can judge.

Playwright needs browsers installed once:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium firefox
```

The dev container does this for you. If your environment already ships a browser
whose build does not match the one Playwright pins, point at it instead of
editing the config:

```bash
E2E_CHROMIUM_PATH=/path/to/chromium E2E_FIREFOX_PATH=/path/to/firefox pnpm run e2e
```

## Deployment

The application is published to GitHub Pages at
**[navbeacon.app](https://navbeacon.app/)** by
the final job in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml). A
deployment is only the static output of `pnpm run build`: there is no host-side
build step and nothing runs on the server.

For a push to `main`, the production build is packaged in the same workflow run
that checks it and is published only after every CI job succeeds. Pull requests
run the checks but never package or publish a Pages artifact. A separate
[`workflow_dispatch` recovery path](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) republishes
`main` by verifying that exact commit's CI gate and reusing its retained Pages
artifact; it neither rebuilds the application nor executes repository code.

Two details make the deployment behave on Pages:

- [`public/CNAME`](./public/CNAME) names the custom domain. It is copied into the
  build by the asset glob in [`angular.json`](./angular.json), so the domain
  survives every deployment. `<base href="/">` in
  [`src/index.html`](./src/index.html) is correct for a domain of our own and
  needs no rewriting.
- The hull schematics ship as two committed files per side rather than as the
  package's SVG: a PNG rasterised by `scripts/convert-ship-artwork.mjs`, and
  about a kilobyte of JSON written by `scripts/extract-schematic-mounts.mts` —
  the drawing's box, the rectangle it draws in and the middle of every annotated
  mount. Ninety kilobytes of sub-pixel path data per side is work a fixed-ratio
  plate would redo on every resize, and only those few hundred bytes of it are
  ever read. Both scripts read the installed `@elite-dangerous-almanac/core`,
  and the extractor runs the application's own parser, so the contract being
  checked and the geometry being written cannot drift.
- Neither file is a private geometry catalogue, and the policy checker is what
  makes that a fact rather than a promise: each extract records the SHA-256 of
  the package SVG it was made from, `pnpm run policy` recomputes it against the
  installed file, and a package SVG tracked under `public/` or `src/` fails
  outright. Re-run both scripts after moving the package pin;
  the [`ship-builder/hull-anatomy`](./openspec/specs/ship-builder/hull-anatomy/spec.md)
  specification is where the rule is written.
- `index.csr.html` is copied to `404.html` before upload. Pages answers any path
  that is not a file with its own 404 page, which would break a deep link into a
  client-side route; serving the application from `404.html` hands those paths to
  the Angular router instead, with no redirect and no hash fragment. It is copied
  from `index.csr.html` — the body-less shell — rather than from `index.html`,
  because `index.html` is now the start page's own document and an unmatched
  address answered with it would show one screen's content at another's address.
- Fifty of the fifty-two addresses `public/sitemap.xml` advertises are **rendered
  at build time**, each to its own `<route>.html`: the root, the hull catalogue
  and all 48 hulls. The body is there before any script runs, which is what a
  crawler that executes none of them can read
  ([`platform/published-addresses`](./openspec/specs/platform/published-addresses/spec.md)). The two benches —
  `/outfitting` and `/equipment` — state nothing until a Commander acts, so they
  keep the head-only document they have always had.
  `404.html` alone catches every address, but Pages serves it with a 404 status,
  and a crawler drops a 404 whatever the body says — so a sitemap of paths that
  only `404.html` answers is a sitemap of errors. `<route>.html` answers 200 with
  no redirect, where `<route>/index.html` would answer 301 to `<route>/`, which
  is why the build moves each rendered document out of the directory Angular
  writes it into. The route list is read out of the sitemap rather than repeated
  in the workflow.
- The output of `pnpm run build` therefore has three kinds of HTML in it: the 50
  rendered documents, `index.csr.html` (the shell the service worker falls back
  to and `404.html` is copied from), and `404.html` itself. Nothing runs on the
  server to produce any of them; per-request rendering stays prohibited
  (constitution 9.1.0, Technology Constraints).

The repository has to be set up once for this to work: **Settings → Pages →
Build and deployment → Source** set to **GitHub Actions**, and a DNS `CNAME`
record for `navbeacon.app` pointing at `darksession.github.io`. Enable **Enforce
HTTPS** once GitHub has issued the certificate.

### Pull request previews

Every pull request raised from a branch of this repository is built a second
time and published as a browsable preview, so a change can be looked at before
it is merged. A sticky comment on the pull request carries the link, the preview
is replaced on every push and removed when the pull request closes.

Previews are published to
**[Nav-Beacon-Preview](https://github.com/DarkSession/Nav-Beacon-Preview)**,
not to this repository, because this repository's Pages site _is_ the production
site: `public/CNAME` points it at `navbeacon.app`, and a repository serves exactly
one Pages site. A preview published from here would land on the production
domain. The preview repository has no custom domain, so its previews reach the
account's default Pages host instead:

```
https://darksession.github.io/Nav-Beacon-Preview/pr-preview/pr-<number>/
```

The [`preview` job in `ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) publishes them and
the [`preview-cleanup.yml`](./.github/workflows/preview-cleanup.yml) workflow
removes them, both through
[`pr-preview-action`](https://github.com/rossjrw/pr-preview-action), pinned to a
commit because it is handed a token that can write to another repository. Four
things are worth knowing about them:

- **A preview waits only for the `Check` job**, not for the end-to-end matrix,
  so it is there to look at while the shards are still running. It gates
  nothing: the production `deploy` job does not need it, and a preview that
  fails cannot hold up a merge.
- **A preview is built separately from the checked build**, because it is served
  from a sub-path rather than from the root of a domain and `<base href>` is
  written into the bundle at build time. The build is otherwise the production
  one, service worker included — the base href reaches `ngsw.json` too.
- **Nothing the application asks for at runtime may be a root-absolute path.**
  A leading `/` looks past the deployment base and misses the file, which is
  invisible at the root of a domain and fatal one directory down. So the locale
  catalogues are `i18n/<tag>.json` relative to the base — `fetch` resolves a
  relative path against the document's base URL — and the `@font-face` sources
  in [`src/styles/_fonts.scss`](./src/styles/_fonts.scss) are
  `fonts/<family>/…woff2` relative to the stylesheet, which is emitted at the
  base. `externalDependencies: ["fonts/*"]` in
  [`angular.json`](./angular.json) is what keeps the bundler from resolving
  those at build time and leaves the relative URL in the emitted CSS. At the
  root of a domain all of them resolve exactly as the absolute paths they
  replaced, so production is unchanged.
- **`public/CNAME` is deleted from the preview** before it is published. Pages
  reads a `CNAME` only at the root of the published branch, so a copy in a
  preview directory is inert, but a file claiming the production domain has no
  business in a preview.
- **Previews share one origin.** `darksession.github.io` is the origin for every
  preview, so saved builds in `localStorage` are visible across them. Each
  preview's service worker is scoped to its own directory and cannot serve
  another.

Pull requests from forks are not previewed: a fork's workflow run cannot read
the deployment token. Their checks still run in full.

Two things have to be set up once, in addition to the production settings above:
in the preview repository, **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source**
set to **Deploy from a branch**, with the branch `gh-pages` and folder `/ (root)`
— the branch is created by the first preview, so publish one before setting
this. And in this repository, a secret named `PREVIEW_PAGES_TOKEN` holding a
fine-grained personal access token owned by `DarkSession`, scoped under **Only
select repositories** to `Nav-Beacon-Preview` alone, with **Repository
permissions → Contents: Read and write** as its only permission. It needs
nothing in this repository; the comment on the pull request is written with the
run's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`. If the secret is missing or expired, the preview job
says so in a warning and does nothing else — a missing preview never fails a
run.

That secret is readable by any workflow run of a pull request raised from a
branch of this repository, because a `pull_request` run executes the workflow
file from its own head. Anyone who can push a branch here can therefore read it,
which is why it is scoped to one repository and one permission and is worth
rotating if branch access changes. It grants nothing over this repository or the
production site.

Angular CLI usage analytics are disabled in [`angular.json`](./angular.json)
(`cli.analytics: false`), so no build — local or in CI — reports to Google. The
application itself sends no telemetry either; the constitution forbids it.

## Specifications

This repository plans with [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec),
configured for both Claude Code (`.claude/skills` and `.claude/commands/opsx`)
and Codex CLI (`.agents/skills`). A specification states what a capability does; a change
states the difference one piece of work makes to it.

| Where                                                     | What it holds                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`openspec/specs/`](./openspec/specs)                     | One specification per capability: its purpose, its requirements, and a scenario for each. This is what the application does.                   |
| `openspec/changes/`                                       | Work in flight: a proposal, delta specifications, a design and a task list. Archiving a change folds its deltas into the specifications.       |
| [`openspec/changes/archive/`](./openspec/changes/archive) | The design and contract documents of the features already built. Source files, tests and specifications cite them by path. Read, not extended. |

The capabilities are grouped by the tool they belong to:

| Group                | Capabilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ship-builder/`      | `hull-catalogue`, `build-lifecycle`, `build-link`, `module-outfitting`, `module-engineering`, `edit-history`, `build-status`, `power-and-heat`, `defence-profile`, `offence-profile`, `mobility-and-jump`, `cost-and-materials`, `hull-anatomy`, `slef-exchange` |
| `equipment-builder/` | `loadout-assembly`, `modifications`, `material-costs`, `loadout-persistence`                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `platform/`          | `design-system`, `accessible-responsive-operation`, `localisation`, `tool-navigation`, `application-delivery`, `published-addresses`, `help-and-licences`                                                                                                        |

`ship-builder/build-status` holds the build's structural status: the package's
validation issues, the line that says a build is valid, and the cargo and
passenger capacity cells. Each of the five metric capabilities — power and heat,
defence, offence, mobility, cost — owns the figures it states, and several are
fenced by a `scripts/policy/*-ownership.mjs` script. The `platform/` capabilities are
the contract every screen obeys.

The project constitution lives in [`CONSTITUTION.md`](./CONSTITUTION.md).

A specification is scoped to a capability and names no screen: it describes
behaviour and the information each screen must convey. Screens are defined in
the design of the change that introduces them, and mapped to the requirements
they satisfy. Every screen composes the one design system; responsiveness, touch
support, accessibility and translatability are behavioural requirements, not
styling choices.

### Working on a specification

With Claude Code or Codex CLI in this repository:

```
/opsx:explore     # think the work through before committing to it
/opsx:propose     # create a change: proposal, specs, design and tasks
/opsx:apply       # work through the tasks
/opsx:archive     # fold the change's deltas into the capability specs
```

Codex reads the same six skills from `.agents/skills` under their own names —
`openspec-explore`, `openspec-propose`, `openspec-apply-change`,
`openspec-archive-change`, `openspec-sync-specs` and `openspec-update-change`.
The CLI is a devDependency, so `pnpm exec openspec list --specs`,
`pnpm exec openspec view` and `pnpm exec openspec validate --specs --strict`
work without a global install.

`scripts/check-specification-record.mjs` (`pnpm run policy:specs`) is the one
script that reads `openspec/`. It reconciles the record against the code that
answers for it: a declared requirement is registered in the coverage ledger, a
help topic answers from a requirement or principle something still declares, a
conformance claim in the record names its excluded criteria, and
`helpRouteCoverage` transcribes feature 012's screen inventory. Nothing else in
the pipeline opens a specification, so a pull request that changes only the
record runs the formatter and that script — about two minutes — and skips the
build, the unit tests, the end-to-end matrix and the preview.

## Contributing

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) says how to raise a defect, how to make a change, and what
the gate expects before a pull request is opened. Taking part means following the
[code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

A wrong figure or a missing module belongs to
[Elite-Dangerous-Almanac](https://github.com/DarkSession/Elite-Dangerous-Almanac/issues), which owns
the game data and the calculations. A security vulnerability goes in a private report rather than an
issue — [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) says how.

## Licence

This project's own code and documentation are **MIT**-licensed — see
[`LICENSE`](./LICENSE), which is also where the terms below are carried in full.

The MIT licence does not cover the Elite Dangerous game data and imagery the
application displays. Those are the property of **Frontier Developments plc**,
reach the application through
[`@elite-dangerous-almanac/core`](https://github.com/DarkSession/Elite-Dangerous-Almanac),
and are used under Frontier's
[media-usage rules](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-dangerous-media-usage-rules.510879/):

> Nav Beacon was created using assets and imagery from Elite Dangerous, with the
> permission of Frontier Developments plc, for non-commercial purposes. It is not
> endorsed by nor reflects the views or opinions of Frontier Developments and no
> employee of Frontier Developments was involved in the making of it.

Those terms are carried here, not granted here. A distribution or use that retains
the covered game data or imagery must comply with them, including the non-commercial
condition; the MIT licence does not lift those terms. The library's bundled catalogues travel under further terms of
their own — some sources state no explicit licence, EDSY-derived material is
CC BY-NC 4.0 — listed in the `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` shipped with the installed
package. Review them before redistributing the data or using it commercially.

The [`platform/help-and-licences`](./openspec/specs/platform/help-and-licences/spec.md)
specification requires the running application to reproduce all of this.
